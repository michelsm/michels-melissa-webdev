My name is Melissa Michels and I am currently enrolled in Web Development as a 
rising junior at Northeastern University. I am majoring in Computer Science 
and Marketing and will be Co-oping at Vistaprint from July - December as 
a Software Engineer. I am looking foward to furthering my passion for
web development as I study this course throughout the Summer I semester
and apply my knowledge on Co-op and my future careers. Some of my previous 
CS courses include: Database Design, Object Oriented Design, Computer Systems, 
Algorithms, Fundamentals of CS I and II.

The purpose of the 'michels-melissa-webdev' repository is to contain the code
for my CS capstone course assignments -- CS4550 Web Development.
